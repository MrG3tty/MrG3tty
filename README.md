- 👋 Hi, I’m @MrG3tty
- 👀 I’m interested in ensuring that my employers network is as secure as it can be. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ethical hacking and c++. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project that would lead to the creation of a tool that I or my fellow pentesters can use during our engagements.
- 📫 I've set up a new discord just for teaming up on projects. I can't say I expect any hits on it, but should you want to ask for help, feedback, or just to chat: https://discord.gg/FN8H2xtVJE
